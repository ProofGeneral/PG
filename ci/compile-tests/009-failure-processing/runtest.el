;; Coq Compile Tests (cct) --
;; ert tests for parallel background compilation for Coq
;;
;; Test a partially successful and partially failing compilation with
;; coq-compile-keep-going. Check that the right files are compiled,
;; locked and unlocked. Check also the case, where unlocking of failed
;; files must be delayed, because some earlier successful require job
;; has not yet locked its ancestors.
;;
;; The dependencies in this test are:
;;
;;    Rb    Rc  Rd
;;    |     |   |
;;    |     c   |
;;    |    /|   |
;;    |   / |   |
;;    |  e  |   d
;;    | ?   |   |
;;    |?    |   |
;;    b     g   /
;;    |   _/|  /
;;    | _/  | /
;;    |/    |/
;;    f     h
;;
;; Rb, Rc and Rd are three different require commands in file a. The
;; dependency e -> b is not present in test 5 and test 10 (but in all
;; other tests). The error always happens in file g, for test 1-5 with
;; coqdep, for tests 6-10 with coqc. There are 10 tests, each with
;; slighly different delays, in 10 versions of the sources, e.g.,
;; a1-a10, b1-b10, and so on.
;;
;; For tests 1-5 coqdep fails on g, when this happens
;;
;; 1: Rb is ready and d still busy
;; 2: f is ready and b and d are still busy and d finishes last
;; 3: f is ready and b and d are still busy and b finishes last
;; 4: RB is ready and Rd is queue waiting
;; 5: without dependency e -> b: Rc, Rd are queue waiting, b finishes last
;;
;;
;; For tests 6-10 coqc fails on g, when this happens
;;
;; 6: Rb is ready and d still busy
;; 7: f is ready and b and d are still busy and d finishes last
;; 8: f is ready and b and d are still busy and b finishes last
;; 9: RB is ready and Rd is queue waiting
;; 10: without dependency b -> e: Rc, Rd are queue waiting, b finishes last
