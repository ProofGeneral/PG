;; ert tests for parallel background compilation for Coq
;;
;; Test parallel background compilation when one require command does
;; not produce any dependencies.
;;
;; The following graph shows the file dependencies in this test:
;; 
;;      a    b
;;           |
;;           c


;; require cct-lib for the elisp compilation, otherwise this is present already
(require 'cct-lib)

;;; set configuration
