;; Coq Compile Tests (cct) --
;; ert tests for parallel background compilation for Coq
;;
;; Test two require jobs with different delays such that
;; coq-par-retire-top-level-job happens when the other require job is
;; in each possible state. For specifying the different delays there
;; are 6 mini projects, one for each test in this file. Each project
;; consists of four files, a1.v, b1.v, c1.v and d1.v for the first one
;; and a6.v, b6.v, c6.v and d6.v for the sixth one.
;;
;; The dependencies are the same in all projects:
;; 
;;           a
;;          / \
;;         b   c
;;          \ /
;;           d
;;
;; Test 1 delays coqdep on require c, such that queue kickoff happens
;; in state 'enqueued-coqdep, the dependency link d->c is created when
;; d is ready and kickoff-queue-maybe on require c happens when
;; require b is in state 'ready.
;;
;; Test 2 delays coqdep on c, such that queue kickoff happens in state
;; 'waiting-dep.
;;
;; Test 3 delays coqdep on require b, such that kickoff-queue-maybe on
;; require c happens when require b is in state 'enqueued-coqdep and
;; queue kickoff happens in state 'waiting-queue.
;;
;; Test 4 delays coqdep on b, such that kickoff-queue-maybe on require
;; c happens when require b is in state 'waiting-dep.
;;
;; Test 5 delays coqdep on d, such that the second dependency on d is
;; created when d is in state enqueued-coqdep.
;;
;; Test 6 delays coqdep on c for 2 seconds and coqc on d for 4
;; seconds, such that the dependency link d->c is created when d is in
;; state enqueued-coqc.
