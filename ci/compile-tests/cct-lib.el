;; Coq Compile Tests (cct) --
;; ert tests for parallel background compilation for Coq
;;
;; This file contains common definitions for the automated tests of
;; parallel background compilation.

;; Require some libraries for the elisp compilation. When compiling,
;; nothing is loaded, but all Proof General directories are in the
;; load path. When this file is loaded as part of a test, proof-site
;; has been loaded but only the generic subdir is in the load path.
;; This file references variables from coq-compile-common and
;; functions from proof-shell, therefore coq-compile-common must be
;; required for compilation. When running a test, these files would be
;; loaded anyway when the test visits the first Coq file. For
;; executing tests, the coq subdir will only be added to the load path
;; when the first Coq file is visited. Therefore we have to add it
;; here via proof-ready-for-assistant. For compilation, we have to
;; require proof-site, otherwise proof-ready-for-assistant won't be
;; defined.
