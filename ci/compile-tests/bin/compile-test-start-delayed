	usage: compile-test-start-delayed key prog args...

	Start program prog with arguments args with some delay. There
	must be at least one argument in args and the last one must be
	a file or something that becomes a file when ".v" is appended.
	The delay is taken from a line in that file that
	contains the key, followed by a space and the delay in seconds
	(maybe somewhere in the middle of the line). The file must
	contain at most one line containing key. When there is no line
	containing key the delay is zero. As a special case, a delay
	equal to X means to record the fact that prog has been called
	on file by creating a file with suffix ".X" added to the name
	of file. The absence of this .X file can then be used, for
	instance, to check that prog has not been called on file. With
	delay equal to X, the real delay is 0.
        Fractional delays are properly handled.
