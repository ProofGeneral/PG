;; Coq Compile Tests (cct) --
;; ert tests for parallel background compilation for Coq
;;
;; Test recompilation and ancestor registration for the case a
;; dependency is in state ready already.
;;
;; The following graph shows the file dependencies in this test:
;;
;;           a
;;          / \
;;         b   c
;;         |   |____________
;;         d                \
;;         |                 |
;;         e--f--g--h--i--j--k
;;
;; The idea is that the coqdep chain from b to j takes so long, that k
;; has been compiled and is in state ready before the coqdep results
;; from j are processed. This works - unless the disk cache is cold.
;; If it works the test triggers two bugs. First, k is locked with the
;; require command of c. Second, the modification time of k is not
;; propagated to j, such that the whole chain from j to b is not
;; recompiled after k has changed.
