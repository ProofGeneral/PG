# This test uses ../bin/compile-test-start-delayed to start certain
# commands with specified delays to check carfully constructed
# internal states. compile-test-start-delayed outputs diagnostics on
# file descriptor 9, which bypasses emacs and is joined with stderr of
# the current make. Open file descriptor 9 here.
