;; ert tests for parallel background compilation for Coq
;;
;; Test that default-directory is correctly set independently of the
;; current buffer in the foreground, both for first and second stage
;; compilation.
;;
;; This test fails for Coq 8.15.0, because the test checks .vok files,
;; which, in certain situations, are not created by that coq version.
;; See Coq issue 15773.
