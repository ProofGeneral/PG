# Introduction

This document describes the general strategy for testing Proof General
with GitHub actions and for building the necessary containers.

**Note:** The portions in this file between the CIPG markers (which
are invisible in the PDF version) are now and then automatically
updated by the `cipg` program. Please consider this when changing this
file.

The file `.github/workflows/test.yml` defines 6 jobs.

build
 : compile Proof General sources to bytecode and build documentation
 
check-doc-magic:
 : check that the documentation strings from the source code that are
   magically included in the manuals are correct
   
test
 : run the tests in `ci/coq-tests.el`
 
compile-tests
 : run the auto-compilation tests in `ci/compile-tests`
 
simple-tests
 : run the Coq tests in `ci/simple-tests`
 
test-indent
 : run Coq source code indentation tests

test-qrhl
 : run the qRHL tests in `ci/simple-tests`

The jobs build, check-doc-magic, test-indent and test-qrhl run on
different Emacs versions but they do not need Coq. They therefore use
the GitHub hosted ubuntu-latest runner together with the
`purcell/setup-emacs` action to install Emacs.

The jobs test, compile-tests and simple-tests need Coq and Emacs in
different version pairs. They therefore use the
`proofgeneral/coq-emacs` docker containers build specifically for
various Coq/Emacs version pairs for this purpose. This is achieved by
installing Nix on specific containers from `coqorg/coq`, see the
`proofgeneral/coq-nix` docker repository, and then installing Emacs
via Nix. There are GitLab and GitHub projects for building these
containers in GitLab pipelines. However, currently this does not work
and the containers are therefore build manually.

This document ignores Coq point releases (e.g., 8.13.2). For one
reason we trust the Coq development team to not introduce changes in
point releases that Proof General should care about. Another reason is
that the `coqorg/coq` docker images are only available for the latest
point release of any minor version. Therefore, in this document, a Coq
version number `<major>.<minor>` always stands for the latest point
release of that minor release. E.g., 8.17 stands for 8.17.1 released
in 2023/06.

# Generic strategy {#generic}

Proof General distinguishes between active and passive support for
certain Coq/Emacs versions pairs. Active support means that tests for
these Coq/Emacs versions pairs run on each pull request and the pull
request should not be merged if one of these tests fails unexpectedly.
Passive support means that the developers refrain from knowingly
breaking the compatibility with passively supported version pairs. (In
the future we plan to also run tests on passively supported version
pairs.)

The actively supported Coq/Emacs version pairs are all Coq/Emacs
version combinations starting from the oldest Coq and the oldest Emacs
version from all Debian and Ubuntu releases that are still enjoying
standard support. For Debian these are the releases whose end of live
date is in the future. For Ubuntu these are the releases whose end of
standard support date is in the future.

Currently, the first actively supported versions are

<!-- The content between the CIPG markers is automatically changed by
 !-- the cipg program. Do not change these markers. -->
<!-- CIPG change marker: coq-emacs-versions -->
| Coq   |  8.11 |
|-------+-------|
| Emacs |  26.3 |
<!-- CIPG change marker end -->

The set of passively supported Coq/Emacs version pairs is work in
progress.

In May 2023, shortly before Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver reached its end
of standard support, all Coq versions since 8.6 and all Emacs versions
since 25.2 were actively supported, resulting in 12 major Coq
versions, 9 Emacs versions and 108 version pairs. 

To keep test runtime and space for containers reasonable, we build
containers only for a subset of the actively supported version pairs
and only a subset of these containers are used by the GitHub action
jobs.

# Container build strategy {#contbuild}

For an actively supported Coq/Emacs version pair (*cv*, *ev*), a
container containing that Coq and Emacs version is built, in case one
of the following points is true for *cv* and *ev*.

#. The Emacs version *ev* is present in an Debian or Ubuntu release
   still enjoying standard support and the Coq version *cv* or an
   earlier Coq version is present in the same release. 
   
   This point is motivated by the ability to reproduce problems in a
   supported Debian or Ubuntu installation in which Coq has been updated
   via opam.

#. The Coq version *cv* has been released within the last two years.

   This point is motivated by the ability to reproduce problems for
   recent Coq versions.
   
#. The pair (*cv*, *ev*) is an historic pair, in the sense that both
   versions were for several month the newest versions in the past.
   E.g., in the second half of 2020 Coq 8.12 and Emacs 27.1 were
   respectively the newest versions for about 6 month. Therefore the
   pair (8.12, 27.1) is considered an historic pair.
   
   This point is motivated by the ability to reproduce Problems for
   versions that may have been used by many people for several month
   in the past.

#. The Coq version *cv* is the newest Coq version or the Emacs version
   *ev* is the newest Emacs version.
   
   This point is motivated by the compatibility of newest versions.

#. The Coq version *cv* is a release candidate.

   This point is motivated by the compatibility of release candidates.


Eventually we will also spell out the container build strategy for the
passively supported versions. For now, in addition to the rules above,
we build containers for the historic pairs of the last 6 years as
passively supported versions.

# Testing strategy

Currently only actively supported versions are tested via GitHub
actions.

## Compilation, indentation and qRHL 

The tests defined for the build, test-indent and test-qrhl jobs run
for all actively supported Emacs versions.

## Up-to-date documentation strings in the manuals

The error scenario here is that a documentation string that is
magically included in the manuals has been updated without updating
the manuals via `make magic`. It is therefore sufficient to run the
test whether the manuals are up-to-date with only the latest two Emacs
major versions.

## Proof General interaction tests with Coq {#coq-ci}

The tests for the GitHub actions test, compile-tests and simple-tests
can obviously only run for those version pairs for which containers
have been build, see [Container build strategy](#contbuild). To limit
the required resources, the tests only run on a subset of the
available containers.

The jobs test, compile-tests and simple-tests run for an actively
supported Coq/Emacs version pair (*cv*, *ev*), in case one of the
following points is true for *cv* and *ev*.

#. The version pair (*cv*, *ev*) is present in an Debian or Ubuntu release
   still enjoying standard support.
   
   This point is for Proof General users using one of these currently
   supported releases.

#. The Emacs version *ev* is present in an Debian or Ubuntu release
   still enjoying standard support and the Coq version *ev* has been
   released in the last 18 month and is either equal or greater than
   the Coq version of this Debian or Ubuntu release.

   This point is for Proof General users that use one of the supported
   Debian or Ubuntu versions and now and then upgrade their Coq version
   via opam.
   
   For example, in October 2023 the 18 month limit includes Coq 8.15
   (last minor version released in 2022/05) but excludes 8.14 (last
   minor version released in 2021/12). Therefore we do test the pair
   (8.15, 27.1) but we don't test (8.14, 27.1). We neither test (8.15,
   27.2), because there is no Debian or Ubuntu release containing
   27.2. Further, we don't test (8.15, 28.2), because Ubuntu 23 and
   Debian 12, which both contain Emacs 28.2, contain Coq 8.16.

#. The pair (*cv*, *ev*) is an historic pair in the same sense as
   above.
   
   This point is motivated by the compatibility with version pairs
   that may have enjoyed some wider use.

#. The Coq version *cv* is the newest Coq version or the Emacs version
   *ev* is the newest Emacs version.
   
   This point is motivated by the compatibility of newest versions.

#. The Coq version *cv* is a release candidate.

   This point is motivated by the compatibility of release candidates.

Running Proof General interaction tests with Coq for passively
supported versions is work in progress.

symbols in the table.


# Keeping the GitHub action up-to-date

Obviously, after each Coq or Emacs release and additionally every few
month the rules in the preceding sections for building containers and
for testing must be re-evaluated and the workflow file
`.github/workflows/test.yml` and the tables in this document must be
updated.

Large portions of this process have been automated. Coq, Emacs, Debian
and Ubuntu releases must be manually added into an Org mode table in
file `coq-emacs-releases.org`. This table is read by the OCaml program
`cipg` that performs the following tasks.

- It evaluates the rules spelled out above and generates the tables in
  the Sections [Generic strategy](#generic), [Container build
  strategy](#contbuild), and [Proof General interaction tests with
  Coq](#coq-ci) in this document.
- It determines missing docker images and generates command lines for
  building them.
- It determines superfluous docker images and offers to delete them.
- It generates the lines that are needed to update
  `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
- It can update this document and `test.yml` in place.
  
  
## Release table

The release table is the Org mode table in file
`coq-emacs-releases.org`. It contains all the data that is needed to
evaluate the rules for building containers and for testing in the
preceding sections. In particular, it contains

- Coq, Emacs, Debian and Ubuntu releases with their release date.
- The end of standard support for Debian and Ubuntu releases.
- The Coq and Emacs versions contained in these Debian and Ubuntu
  releases.
- The historic pairs.

The remainder of this section explains how to maintain this table such
that `cipg` can process it.

#. Whenever a new version of Coq, Emacs, Debian or Ubuntu is released,
   a line needs to be added manually to the release table.

#. The date must be present in every line in the form YYYY/MM.

#. There are 3 kinds of lines in the table.

   Coq releases
   : are specified with a date and a Coq version.
   
   Emacs releases
   : are specified with a date and an Emacs version.
   
   Debian or Ubuntu releases
   : are specified with a date, a distribution name and an EOL date.
   
#. The Coq and Emacs versions of an Debian or Ubuntu release may be
   omitted. If they are not present, they are taken from the last
   preceding line containing the respective version (the table is
   processed from bottom to top). E.g., the line specifying the
   release of Ubuntu 20.4 (on 2020/04) inherits Coq version 8.11.0
   from the preceding line and Emacs version 26.3 from 5 lines below.
   
#. The lines do not need to be sorted by date. I find it clearer to
   insert Debian and Ubuntu releases at a place where they can inherit
   the Coq and maybe the Emacs version from a previous line, such that
   these version numbers can be omitted. E.g., the line for Debian 11
   Bullseye released in 2021/08 appears before the Coq release 8.12.1
   in 2020/11, because Bullseye was released with 8.12.0.
   
   Sometimes it is impossible to move a Debian or Ubuntu release line
   to a place where it can inherit both, the Coq and Emacs version,
   without scrambling the table too much. E.g., Ubuntu 22 was released
   with Coq 8.15.0 and Emacs 27.1. In this case I prefer to keep the
   table sorted by Coq releases, to specify the Emacs version for
   Ubuntu 22, and move the line to a place where it can inherit the Coq
   version. The Emacs column therefore contains some discontinuities
   (together with the date column).
   
#. Historical pairs must be manually marked in column `historic`. They
   are mainly used to manually select some additional version pairs
   for testing and to have some sort of diagonal in the version matrix
   for Proof General interaction tests.

#. The EOL date of Debian or Ubuntu releases must also be in the form
   YYYY/MM. Trailing non-digit characters are ignored. I use `?` to
   indicate EOL dates that have not yet been fixed.

#. In Coq version numbers the patch level is ignored. Versions of
   release candidates must be of the form `8.10rc` or `8.10-rc`.
   `cipg` is not able to recognize outdated release candidates. The
   release candidate must therefore be deleted when the release
   happens.


## `cipg`

`cipg` is the OCaml program `ci/tools/cipg.ml` in the Proof General
repository that automates many tasks for keeping the Proof General
GitHub action up-to-date. `cipg` can be compiled with `ocamlopt.opt -g
-o cipg unix.cmxa cipg.ml`, see also the `compile-command` in
`cipg.ml`. By default, `cipg` assumes that `../..` is the root
directory of the PG repository, which is right, if `cipg` runs in
`ci/tools`. Use option `-pg-repo` to specify a different directory as
Proof-General repository.

### Dependencies and credentials

`cipg` runs `curl` and `jq` as subcommands. They must be located
somewhere on `PATH`.

The deletion of docker images (via option `-delete`) requires
credentials for `hub.docker.com`. Currently, `cipg` can only use
credentials specified in `~/.authinfo`. If `-delete` is used, this
file must contain a simple 6-element entry for host `hub.docker.com`
without quotes of the form
```
machine hub.docker.com login <user> password <passwd>
```
The restriction of a simple line without quotes means that usernames
or passwords containing spaces are currently not supported.


### Obtaining information

Without any options, `cipg` reads the release table in
`coq-emacs-releases.org` and outputs the relevant information for
Proof General continuous integration and testing on the current date.
In particular, `cipg` prints the table of containers to build and the
table of Coq/Emacs version pairs selected for those jobs that test Coq
and Emacs in different version pairs.

With option `-check`, `cipg` additionally checks if all needed docker
images exist in the docker registry and if there are any superfluous
images. For missing docker images `cipg` prints docker build commands
that work with the dockerfiles in the `coq-nix-docker` and
`coq-emacs-docker` repositories. For these commands, `cipg` emits
`pushd` commands to change into directories inside the respective
repositories. The directory where the two repositories are checked out
can be set with command line option `-src-dir`, the default is
`~/src`.

With option `-ci-print`, `cipg` additionally prints the lines with the
versions for the matrix version variables of all jobs in `test.yml`.
These lines can be copied into `test.yml`, but see option `-ci-change`
below.


### Updating the CI configuration

The options described in this subsection perform destructive updates
or removals. Use them with care.

The option `ci-change` updates `README.md` (this file) and `test.yml`
in the Proof-General repository identified by `cipg` with the new
configuration. See option `-pg-repo` to change the Proof General
repository. The updates are done in place, without taking backups,
which is not a problem, if there are no unstaged changes. In
particular, the option `ci-change` changes

- the three tables in the Sections [Generic strategy](#generic),
  [Container build strategy](#contbuild), and [Proof General
  interaction tests with Coq](#coq-ci) in this document, including the
  numbers of containers and Coq/Emacs version pairs in front of the
  last two tables, and
- the versions for the matrix version variables of all jobs in
  `test.yml`.

To facilitate these automatic updates `README.md` and `test.yml`
contain âCIPG change markersâ in comments before and after the to be
replaced portions.

With option `-delete`, `cipg` offers to delete superfluous containers.
For each superfluous container, `cipg` asks, whether to really delete
it.


### Accessing `hub.docker.com`

This subsection documents how `cipg` accesses `hub.docker.com`. The
information here is not relevant for using `cipg`. For easy
copy/paste, the commands in this section are on one line in the
markdown sources, which may result in overly long lines and
incorrectly inserted line breaks in the PDF version.

To list all tags of the `proofgeneral/coq-emacs` image use
```
curl -L -s 'https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/proofgeneral/coq-emacs/tags?page_size=1024' | jq '."results"[]["name"]'
```
If the `page_size` number is too small only some first portion is
printed.

The shell commands for deleting a docker image are taken from the
folling stackoverflow article.
```
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44209644/how-do-i-delete-a-docker-image-from-docker-hub-via-command-line
```
In order to delete an image, one first needs get an access token,
which is a string more than 2500 characters long. To save a new access
token in variable `XX` do
```
XX=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"username\": \"<user>\", \"password\": \"<passwd>\"}" https://hub.docker.com/v2/users/login/ | jq -r .token)
```
In this line, `<user>` and `<passwd>` must be replaced with some valid
credentials.

To delete tag `coq-8.18-rc-emacs-27.1` of the `proofgeneral/coq-emacs`
docker images use
```
curl -i -X DELETE -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: JWT $XX" https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/proofgeneral/repositories/coq-emacs/tags/coq-8.18-rc-emacs-27.1
```
Note the use of `XX` in this line.

Alternatively, the command
```
curl -i -X DELETE -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: JWT $XX" https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/proofgeneral/coq-emacs/tags/coq-8.18-rc-emacs-26.3/
```
does also delete a tag. However, the first deletion command is said to
be preferred in the cited stackoverflow article.
