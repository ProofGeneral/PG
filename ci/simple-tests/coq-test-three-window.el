;; Starting Proof General in three-pane mode
;; (`proof-three-window-enable' is t and
;; `proof-three-window-mode-policy' is 'smart) used to fail with
;; "window ... too small for splitting" for frame heights less then
;; three times `window-min-height' (which defaults to 4). The problem
;; was relevant for Emacs 26.3, 27.1, and 27.2 running in batch mode
;; in docker containers, because they set their frame height to 9 (and
;; their width to 10) in such environments. For this reason most Proof
;; General CI tests disable three pane mode in one or the other way.
;;
;; This file tests that the internal function `proof-select-three-b'
;; creates 3 windows if the frame height is big enough. Additionally,
;; it is tested that one user command
;; (`proof-toggle-active-scripting') that used to be affected by the
;; bug does not signal an error, regardless of the frame size. Both
;; functions are tested with three different frame sizes: too small
;; for 3 windows, just big enough for 3 windows, and the default frame
;; size.
