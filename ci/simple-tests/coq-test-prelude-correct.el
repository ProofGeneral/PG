;; Test that the Proof General prelude is correct.
;;
;; I use Proof General prelude here to refer to the initialization
;; commands that Proof General sends to Coq before the first command
;; of the script.

;; This test shows different behaviour before 8.10. When the problem
;; is fixed, I expect that the version distinction is no longer
;; necessary and can be deleted.
