Stuff to do to clean up the code
--------------------------------

Probably the "invisible" command things can go
These are commands that user does not see, not part of script
Can just call send-to-prover, yes?

Localize all state

Use cl-lib throughout

Either update or ditch the Adapting document
We could describe how to use different protocols
Right now, all the comms stuff is in coq/, though

generic/proof-resolver.el probably doesn't need much of what's there

ditch generic/proof-shell.el, but there is code that uses it, so careful

Makefile.devel mentions cvs; update that to git, or ditch it?

generic/proof-easy-config is probably ditchable

Go through autoloads, see what's what

Is generic/pg-xml.el still used? It's used in pg-movie.el, pgip.el
Bits of it are redundant with coq/coq-xml.el

in bin/proofgeneral, make it executable
remove references to other provers
