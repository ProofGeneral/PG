;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Generic code for the communication with prooftree. Prooftree
;; is an ocaml-gtk program that displays proof trees.
;;
;; The main problem with proof tree visualization is that Coq (and
;; probably other proof assistants as well) does not provide any
;; information about which subgoals are new and have been created by
;; the last proof command and which subgoals stem from older proof
;; commands.
;;
;; To solve this problem prooftree relies on unique identification
;; strings of goals, which are called goal or sequent ID's in the
;; code. With these ID's it is easy to keep track which goals are new.
;;
;; A second problem is that, for an undo command, Coq (and probably
;; other proof assistants as well) does not tell which subgoals and
;; which finished branches must be deleted. Therefore prooftree needs
;; a continuously increasing proof state number and keeps a complete
;; undo history for every proof.
;;
;; A third problem is that Coq (and probably other proof assistants as
;; well) is not able to generate the information for a proof tree in
;; the middle of a proof. Therefore, if the user wants to start the
;; proof-tree display in the middle of the proof, it is necessary to
;; retract to the start of the proof and then to reassert to the
;; previous end of the locked region. To achieve this, one has to call
;; `accept-process-output' at suitable points to let Proof General
;; process the `proof-action-list'.
;; 
;; A fourth problem is that proof-tree display can only work when the
;; prover output is not suppressed (via `proof-full-annotation').
;; `proof-shell-should-be-silent' takes care of that.
;; 
;; The design of Prooftree, of the glue code inside Proof General
;; (mostly in this file) and of the communication protocol tries to
;; achieve the following two goals:
;;
;;   * Functionality is preferably transferred into prooftree, to
;;     enlarge Proof General not unnecessarily.
;;
;;   * To avoid synchronization trouble the communication between
;;     Proof General and prooftree is almost one way only: Only Proof
;;     General sends display or undo commands to Prooftree. Prooftree
;;     never requests any proof-state information from Proof General.
;;     Prooftree only sends a quit message to Proof General when the
;;     user closes the proof-tree display of the current proof. This
;;     goal requires that some of the heuristics, which decide which
;;     subgoals are new and which have to be refreshed, have to be
;;     implemented here.
;;
;; In general the glue code here works on the delayed output. That is,
;; the glue code here runs when the next proof command has already
;; been sent to the proof assistant. The glue code makes a light
;; analysis on the output of the proof assistant, extracts the
;; necessary parts with regular expressions and sends appropriate
;; commands to prooftree. This is achieved by calling the main entry
;; here, the function `proof-tree-handle-delayed-output' from the
;; proof shell filter function after `proof-shell-exec-loop' has
;; finished.
;;
;; However, some aspects can not be delayed. Those are treated by
;; `proof-tree-urgent-action'. Its primary use is for inserting
;; special goal-displaying commands into `proof-action-list' before
;; the next real proof command runs. For Coq this needs to be done for
;; newly generated subgoals and for goals that contain an existential
;; variable that got instantiated in the last proof step.
;;
;; Actually, for every proof, Prooftree can display a set of disjunct
;; proof trees, which are organized into layers. More than one proof
;; tree in more than one layer is needed to support the Grap
;; Existential Variables command in Coq. There is one proof tree in
;; the first layer for the original goal. The second layer contains
;; all the goals that the first Grab Existential Variables command
;; created from uninstantiated existential variabes in the main proof.
;; The third layer contains the goals that the second Grap Existential
;; Variables created.
