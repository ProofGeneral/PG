\(fn &optional START END)" t nil)

(autoload 'holes-mode "../lib/holes" "\
Toggle Holes minor mode.
With arg, turn Outline minor mode on if arg is positive, off otherwise.

The mode `holes-mode' is meant to help program editing.  It is
useful to build complicated expressions by copy pasting several
peices of text from different parts of a buffer (or even from
different buffers).

HOLES

A hole is a piece of (highlighted) text that may be replaced by
another part of text later.  There is no information stored on the
file for holes, so you can save and modify files containing holes with
no harm... You can even insert or delete characters inside holes like
any other characters.

USE

At any time only one particular hole, called \"active\", can be
\"filled\".  Holes can be in several buffers but there is always one or
zero active hole globally.  It is highlighted with a different color.

Functions described below have default shortcuts when `holes-mode' is
on that you can customize.

TO DEFINE A HOLE, two methods:

 o Select a region with keyboard or mouse, then use
   \\[holes-set-make-active-hole].  If the selected region is empty,
   then a hole containing # is created at point.

 o Select text with mouse while pressing ctrl and meta (`C-M-select').
   If the selected region is empty (i.e. if you just click while
   pressing ctrl+meta), then a hole containing # is created.

TO ACTIVATE A HOLE, click on it with the button 1 of your mouse.  The
previous active hole will be deactivated.

TO FORGET A HOLE without deleting its text, click on it with the
button 2 (middle) of your mouse.

TO DESTROY A HOLE and delete its text, click on it with the button 3
of your mouse.

TO FILL A HOLE with a text selection, first make sure it is active,
then two methods:

 o Select text with keyboard or mouse and hit
   \\[holes-replace-update-active-hole]

 o Select text with mouse while pressing ctrl, meta and shift
   (`C-M-S-select').  This is a
   generalization of the `mouse-track-insert' feature of XEmacs.  This
   method allows you to fill different holes faster than with the usual
   copy-paste method.

After replacement the next hole is automatically made active so you
can fill it immediately by hitting again
\\[holes-replace-update-active-hole] or `C-M-S-select'.

TO JUMP TO THE ACTIVE HOLE, just hit
\\[holes-set-point-next-hole-destroy].  You must
be in the buffer containing the active hole.  the point will move to
the active hole, and the active hole will be destroyed so you can type
something to put at its place.  The following hole is automatically
made active, so you can hit \\[holes-set-point-next-hole-destroy]
again.

It is useful in combination with abbreviations.  For example in
`coq-mode' \"fix\" is an abbreviation for Fixpoint # (# : #) {struct #} :
# := #, where each # is a hole. Then hitting
\\[holes-set-point-next-hole-destroy] goes from one hole to the
following and you can fill-in each hole very quickly.

COMBINING HOLES AND SKELETONS

`holes' minor mode is made to work with minor mode `skeleton' minor
mode.

KNOWN BUGS

 o Don't try to make overlapping holes, it doesn't work. (what would
it mean anyway?)

 o Cutting or pasting a hole will not produce new holes, and
undoing on holes cannot make holes re-appear.

(autoload 'defpacustom "pg-pamacs" "\
Define a setting NAME for the current proof assistant, default VAL.
Mainly intended for configuring settings of running provers,
which can be changed by sending commands.

In this case, NAME stands for the internal setting, flag, etc,
for the proof assistant, and a :setting and :type value should be
provided.  The :type of NAME should be one of 'integer, 'float,
'boolean, 'string. Other types are not supported (see
`proof-menu-entry-for-setting'). They will yield an error when
constructing the proof assistant menu.

The function `proof-assistant-format' is used to format VAL.

This macro invokes the standard Emacs `defcustom' macro, so this
also defines a customizable setting inside Emacs.  The
customization variable is automatically put into the group
named after the prover.

If NAME corresponds instead to a PG internal setting, then a form :eval to
evaluate can be provided instead.

Additional properties in the ARGS prop list may include:

 pggroup   string    A grouping name for the setting, in case there are many.
		     For example, \"Timing\", \"Tracing\", etc.  Used
		     to generate sub-menus in the UI.

 pgdynamic flag      If flag is non-nil, this setting is a dynamic one
		     that is particular to the running instance of the prover.

This macro also extends the `proof-assistant-settings' list.

We execute the callback (ACTION SPAN) on the first item,
