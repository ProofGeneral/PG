;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Proof General is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants
;; (also known as interactive theorem provers).
;;
;; It is supplied ready to use for the proof assistants Coq,
;; EasyCrypt, and PhoX.
;;
;; See https://proofgeneral.github.io/ for installation instructions
;; and online documentation.  Or browse the accompanying info manual:
;; (info-display-manual "ProofGeneral")
;;
;; Regarding the Coq proof assistant, you may be interested in the
;; company-coq extension of ProofGeneral (also available in MELPA).

;;; Code:

;; Proof General's initialization code (in generic/proof-site) is relatively
;; complex, in part because it was written before package.el existed, and in
;; part because package.el still doesn't look for autoloads in subdirectories.
;; This file is a thin, package.el-friendly wrapper around generic/proof-site,
;; suitable for execution on Emacs start-up.  It serves two purposes:
;;
;; * Setting up the load path when byte-compiling PG.
;; * Loading a minimal PG setup on startup (not all of Proof General, of course;
;;   mostly mode hooks and autoloads).

;;;###autoload
(eval-and-compile
  (defvar pg-init--script-full-path
    (or (bound-and-true-p byte-compile-current-file)
        (and load-in-progress load-file-name)

        (buffer-file-name)))
  (defvar pg-init--pg-root
    (file-name-directory pg-init--script-full-path)))

;;;###autoload

  ;; This require breaks compilation, so it must only run when loading the package.

  ;; FIXME: This is used during installation of the ELPA package:
  ;; we presume that this file will be compiled before any of the files in
  ;; sub-directories and we presume that all files are compiled within the same
  ;; session, so we here add to load-path all the subdirectories so
  ;; that files in (say) coq/ can (require 'coq-foo) and the compiler will find
  ;; the corresponding file.
