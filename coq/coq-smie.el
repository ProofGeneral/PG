;;; Commentary:

;; Lexer.

;; Due to the verycomplex grammar of Coq, and to the architecture of
;; smie, we deambiguate all kinds of tokens during lexing. This is a
;; complex piece of code but it allows for all smie goodies.
;; Some examples of deambigations:
;; - We distinguish ":=" from ":= inductive" to avoid the circular precedence
;;   constraint ":= < | < ; < :=" where ":= < |" is due to Inductive
;;   definitions, "| < ;" is due to tactics precedence, "; < :=" is due to
;;   "let x:=3; y:=4 in...".
;; - We distinguish the ".-selector" from the terminator "." for
;;   obvious reasons.
;; - We consider qualified.names as one single token for obvious reasons.
;; - We distinguish the "Module M." from "Module M := exp." since the first
;;   opens a new scope (closed by End) whereas the other doesn't.
;; - We drop "Program" because it's easier to consider "Program Function"
;;   as a single token (which behaves like "Function" w.r.t indentation and
;;   parsing) than to get the parser to handle it correctly.
;; - We identify the different types of bullets (First approximation).
;; - We distinguish "with match" from other "with".
