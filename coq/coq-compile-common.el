This option controls whether ``-quick'' is used for parallel
background compilation and whether up-date .vo or .vio files are
used or deleted. Please use the customization system to change
this option to ensure that any ``-quick'' setting is ignored for
Coq before 8.5.

Note that ``-quick'' can be noticebly slower when your sources do
not declare section variables with ``Proof using''. Note that
even if you do declare section variables, ``-quick'' is typically
slower on small files.

Use the default `no-quick', if you have not yet switched to
``Proof using''. Use `quick-no-vio2vo', if you want quick
recompilation without producing .vo files. Value
`quick-and-vio2vo' updates missing prerequisites with ``-quick''
and starts vio2vo conversion on a subset of the availables
cores (see `coq-compile-vio2vo-percentage') when the quick
recompilation finished (but see below for a .vio .vo
incompatibility caveat). Note that all the previously described
modes might load .vio files and that you therefore might not
notice certain universe inconsistencies. Finally, use `ensure-vo'
for only importing .vo files with complete universe checks.

Detailed description of the 4 modes:

no-quick         Compile outdated prerequisites without ``-quick'',
                 producing .vo files, but don't compile prerequisites
                 for which an up-to-date .vio file exists. Delete
                 or overwrite outdated .vo files.

quick-no-vio2vo  Compile outdated prerequisites with ``-quick'',
                 producing .vio files, but don't compile prerequisites
                 for which an up-to-date .vo file exists. Delete
                 or overwrite outdated .vio files.

quick-and-vio2vo Same as `quick-no-vio2vo', but start vio2vo processes
                 after the last ``Require'' command has been processed
                 to convert the vio dependencies into vo files. With this
                 mode you might see asynchronous errors from vio2vo
                 compilation while you are processing stuff far below the
                 last require. vio2vo compilation is done on a subset of
                 the available cores, see `coq-compile-vio2vo-percentage'.
                 When `coq-compile-keep-going' is set, vio2vo compilation
                 is scheduled for those files for which coqc compilation
                 was successful.

                 Warning: This mode does only work when you process require
                 commands in batches. Slowly single-stepping through require's
                 might lead to inconsistency errors when loading some
                 libraries, see Coq issue #5223.

ensure-vo        Ensure that all library dependencies are present as .vo
                 files and delete outdated .vio files or .vio files that
                 are more recent than the corresponding .vo file. This
                 setting is the only one that ensures soundness.
