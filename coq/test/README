These are tests for Proof General using the XML protocol for Coq.

The bash script "run-tests.sh" runs tests in the tests/ directory. You can
supply the name of individual tests from that directory on the command line:

   run-tests.sh example-test example-tokens-test

If you omit the tests on the command-line, all available tests are run.

You will probably need to edit the variable PROOF_SITE in "run-tests.sh" to
allow Emacs to file Proof General.

When running a test, the script starts up Emacs with Proof General, and runs
some Elisp code. On the console, the script prints what you should look for
to know whether a test is successful. The script then asks whether you think
the test has succeeded or not.

When all tests have run, the script offers you the opportunity to see all the
test results.

To add a new test to this suite, create a file in the tests/
directory. Any Coq code should go in the scripts/ directory. Each test
requires defining two bash variables, CODE and ADVICE. The first of
these is the Elisp code to run, and the second is the advice to the
user to know whether a test has succeeded. See one of the existing
files to know how to instantiate those variables. Also, add the name
of the file to the variable ALL_TESTS in "run-tests.sh".
