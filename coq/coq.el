  "Check for new subgoals and issue appropriate Show commands.
This is a hook function for `proof-tree-urgent-action-hook'. This
function examines the current goal output and searches for new
unknown subgoals. Those subgoals have been generated by the last
proof command and we must send their complete sequent text
eventually to prooftree. Because subgoals may change with
the next proof command, we must execute the additionally needed
Show commands before the next real proof command.

The ID's of the open goals are checked with
`proof-tree-sequent-hash' in order to find out if they are new.
For any new goal an appropriate Show Goal command with a
'proof-tree-show-subgoal flag is inserted into
`proof-action-list'. Then, in the normal delayed output
processing, the sequent text is send to prooftree as a sequent
update (see `proof-tree-update-sequent') and the ID of the
sequent is registered as known in `proof-tree-sequent-hash'.

Searching for new subgoals must only be done when the proof is
not finished, because Coq 8.5 lists open existential variables
as (new) open subgoals. For this test we assume that
`proof-marker' has not yet been moved.
