;;
;; This file implements compilation of required modules. The
;; compilation is done in parallel in the background (in contrast to
;; what you find in coq-seq-compile.el).
;;
;;
;;; TODO
;;
;; - fix -I current-dir argument for coqc invocations
;; - add option coq-par-keep-compilation-going
;; - check what happens if coq-par-coq-arguments gets a bad load path
;; - on error, try to put location info into the error message
;;
;; Note that all argument computations inherit `coq-autodetected-version': when
;; changing compilers, all compilation jobs must be terminated.  This is
;; consistent with the fact that the _CoqProject file is not reparsed.

;;
;; Multiple file handling -- parallel compilation of required modules
;;

;; This file implements parallel background compilation. It makes sure
;; that only a certain number (`coq-max-background-compilation-jobs')
;; of coqdep anc coqc processes are running in the background.
;;
;; In this file, compilation jobs are uninterned lisp symbols that
;; store all important information in their property list. New
;; compilation jobs are created when Require commands are parsed and
;; when the output of coqdep is processed. If there is space, new jobs
;; are directly launched. Otherwise, they are put into a queue
;; (`coq-par-compilation-queue') to be launched when some other
;; process terminates.
;;
;; Dependencies between files are reflected with suitable links. They
;; are established when the coqdep output is processed. A job with
;; dependencies waits for the dependencies to finish before it
;; continues with coqc.
;; 
;; It is pretty clear how to process these compilation jobs. The
;; problems are:
;;
;; 1- where to put the Require command and the items that follow it
;; 2- make sure ancestors are properly locked
;; 3- error reporting
;;
;; For 1- where to put the Require command and the items that follow it:
;;
;; The Require command and the items that follow cannot stay in
;; proof-action-list, as otherwise they would be sent to the prover
;; long before the compilation finishes. I therefore cut
;; proof-action-list into pieces and leave only the items before the
;; first Require on proof-action-list. The others are put into the
;; 'queueitems property of the top level compilation job. When this
;; job finishes, it puts the items back into proof-action-list and
;; lets Proof General process them as usual.
;;
;; When one Require command lists several modules or if there are
;; several Require commands, every required module gets its own
;; top-level compilation job and the queue items are stored with the
;; last module from each Require command. All these top-level
;; compilation jobs have so-called queue-depencency links between
;; them. These links ensure that a top-level module puts its items
;; back into proof-action-list only if all top-level jobs of those
;; modules that are required before it are finished.
;;
;; A problem occurs with "Require b a.", where b depends on a. To
;; avoid cycles in the dependency graph, here the top-level
;; compilation job for "a" will be a so-called clone of the real
;; compilation job. The Require item is stored with the clone. The
;; real job has dependency links to all its clones. Every clone waits
;; until its real job has finished.
;;
;; For 2- make sure ancestors are properly locked:
;;
;; The problem is "Require b. Require a.", where b depends on a. Here,
;; file a.v will be locked when the dependency b -> a is not known yet
;; to Proof General. Nevertheless, a.v must be associated with the
;; first Require command. Otherwise, a.v would be wrongly unlocked,
;; when only "Require a." is retracted.
;;
;; The problem is solved with the 'coq-locked-ancestors property of
;; spans that contain Require commands and with the
;; coq-par-ancestor-files hash. Ancestors in the 'coq-locked-ancestors
;; property are unlocked when this span is retracted. As locking is
;; done eagerly (as soon as coqdep runs first on the file), I only
;; have to make sure the right files appear in 'coq-locked-ancestors.
;;
;; Ancestor files accumulate in compilation jobs when the compilation
;; walks upwards the dependency tree. In the end, every top-level job
;; contains a list of all its direct and indirect ancestors. Because
;; of eager locking, all its ancestors are already locked, when a
;; top-level job is about to be retired. The coq-par-ancestor-files
;; hash therefore records whether some ancestor does already appear in
;; the 'coq-locked-ancestors property of some span before the current
;; one. If it doesn't, I store it in the current span.
;;
;; For 3- error reporting:
;;
;; For now, all compilation jobs are killed on the first error. All
;; items that are not yet asserted are retract. This is done with
;; signalling an error and calling `coq-par-emergency-cleanup' in the
;; sentinel, if there was an error.
