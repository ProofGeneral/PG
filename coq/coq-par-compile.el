;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file implements compilation of required modules. The
;; compilation is done in parallel in the background (in contrast to
;; what you find in coq-seq-compile.el).
;;
;;
;;; TODO
;;
;; - fix -I current-dir argument for coqc invocations
;; - add option coq-par-keep-compilation-going
;; - check what happens if coq-par-coq-arguments gets a bad load path
;; - on error, try to put location info into the error message
;;
;; Note that all argument computations inherit `coq-autodetected-version': when
;; changing compilers, all compilation jobs must be terminated.  This is
;; consistent with the fact that the _CoqProject file is not reparsed.

;;
;; Multiple file handling -- parallel compilation of required modules
;;

;; This file implements parallel background compilation. It makes sure
;; that only a certain number (`coq-max-background-compilation-jobs')
;; of coqdep anc coqc processes are running in the background.
;;
;; In this file, compilation jobs are uninterned lisp symbols that
;; store all important information in their property list. New
;; compilation jobs are created when Require commands are parsed and
;; when the output of coqdep is processed. If there is space, new jobs
;; are directly launched. Otherwise, they are put into a queue
;; (`coq-par-compilation-queue') to be launched when some other
;; process terminates.
;;
;; Dependencies between files are reflected with suitable links. They
;; are established when the coqdep output is processed. A job with
;; dependencies waits for the dependencies to finish before it
;; continues with coqc.
;; 
;; It is pretty clear how to process these compilation jobs. The
;; problems are:
;;
;; 1- where to put the Require command and the items that follow it
;; 2- make sure ancestors are properly locked
;; 3- error reporting
;; 4- using -quick and the handling of .vo/.vio prerequisites
;;
;; For 1- where to put the Require command and the items that follow it:
;;
;; The Require command and the items that follow cannot stay in
;; proof-action-list, as otherwise they would be sent to the prover
;; long before the compilation finishes. I therefore cut
;; proof-action-list into pieces and leave only the items before the
;; first Require on proof-action-list. The others are put into the
;; 'queueitems property of the top level compilation job. When this
;; job finishes, it puts the items back into proof-action-list and
;; lets Proof General process them as usual.
;;
;; When one Require command lists several modules or if there are
;; several Require commands, every required module gets its own
;; top-level compilation job and the queue items are stored with the
;; last module from each Require command. All these top-level
;; compilation jobs have so-called queue-depencency links between
;; them. These links ensure that a top-level module puts its items
;; back into proof-action-list only if all top-level jobs of those
;; modules that are required before it are finished.
;;
;; A problem occurs with "Require a. Require a.", where two different
;; action list pieces must be stored with the job for a. The solution
;; here is to clone the original job when it is needed more than one
;; time. This cloning is done in general and not only for top-level
;; jobs. So also when a.v and b.v both depend on c.v, the second
;; dependency link is managed by a clone of the job for c.v. Every
;; real job has dependency links to all its clones. All clones wait
;; until the original job has finished. (In retrospect it seems a
;; design without clone jobs might have been cleaner.)
;;
;; For 2- make sure ancestors are properly locked:
;;
;; The problem is "Require b. Require a.", where b depends on a. Here,
;; file a.v will be locked when the dependency b -> a is not known yet
;; to Proof General. Nevertheless, a.v must be associated with the
;; first Require command. Otherwise, a.v would be wrongly unlocked,
;; when only "Require a." is retracted.
;;
;; The problem is solved with the 'coq-locked-ancestors property of
;; spans that contain Require commands. Ancestors in the
;; 'coq-locked-ancestors property are unlocked when this span is
;; retracted. As locking is done eagerly (as soon as coqdep runs first
;; on the file), I only have to make sure the right files appear in
;; 'coq-locked-ancestors.
;;
;; Ancestors accumulate in compilation jobs when the compilation walks
;; upwards the dependency tree. In the end, every top-level job
;; contains a list of all its direct and indirect ancestors in its
;; 'ancestors property. Because of eager locking, all its ancestors
;; are already locked, when a top-level job is about to be retired.
;; Every job records in his 'locked propery whether the file
;; corresponding to this job has been registered in some
;; 'coq-locked-ancestors property already.
;;
;; For 3- error reporting:
;;
;; Depending on `coq-compile-keep-going' compilation can continue
;; after an error or stop immediately. For stopping immediately,
;; processing is aborted with a signal that eventually leads to
;; `coq-par-emergency-cleanup', which kills all compilation jobs,
;; retracts the queue region and resets all internal data.
;;
;; For `coq-compile-keep-going', the failing job and all dependants
;; are marked as 'failed. Queue dependants are marked with
;; 'queue-failed. These marked jobs continue with their normal state
;; transition, but omit certain steps (eg., running coqc). The first
;; tricky part is how to unlock ancestors. When marking jobs as
;; failed, their ancestors (and thereby also the files for the jobs
;; themselves) are unlocked, unless they are still participating in an
;; ongoing compilation. If a coqc compilation finishes and all
;; dependants are marked as failed, ancestors are also unlocked in the
;; same way. If a top-level job is marked as 'queue-failed, its
;; ancestors are unlocked when this job finishes coqc compilation.
;;
;; The second tricky part is how to delete the queue region. For that
;; the last top-level job is delayed until proof-action-list is empty.
;; Then the whole queue is deleted.
;;
;; For 4- using -quick and the handling of .vo/.vio prerequisites
;;
;; Coq accepts both .vo and .vio files for importing modules
;; regardless of it is running with -quick or not. However, it is
;; unclear which file is loaded when both, .vo and .vio, of a
;; dependency are present. Therefore I delete a .vio file when I
;; decide to rebuild a .vo file and vica versa. coqdep delivers
;; dependencies for both, .vio and .vo files. These dependencies are
;; identical for .vio and vo (last checked for coq trunk in October
;; 2016). For deciding whether prerequisites must be recompiled the
;; full path returned form coqdep is relevant. Because it seems odd to
;; store a full path without a .vo or .vio suffix I decided to always
;; store the .vo object file name in the 'vo-file property of
;; compilation jobs. Only when all dependencies are ready, in
;; `coq-par-job-needs-compilation' I decide whether to build a .vio or
;; .vo file and if already present .vo or .vio files must be deleted.
;; Only at that point the relevant property 'required-obj-file is set.

dependency from QUEUE-DEP to the new compilation job. If nil, a
newly created clone job will proceed to state ready if the
original job is ready. Argument REQUIRE-SPAN should be present
when the new job should update the ancestor list in some span.
Argument DEPENDANT tells who required MODULE-OBJ-FILE, this is
used only for the error message, in case MODULE-OBJ-FILE refers
to the current scriping buffer.

If the new job is a clone job, its state is
- 'waiting-dep if the original file job is not 'ready yet
- 'waiting-queue if the original file job is ready, but there is
  a queue dependency QUEUE-DEP (which cannot be ready yet)
- 'ready otherwise

If the new job is a 'file job its state is 'enqueued-coqdep. If
there is space, coqdep is started immediately, otherwise the new
job is put into the compilation queue.

This function returns the newly created job."
