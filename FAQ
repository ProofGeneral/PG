FAQs for using/installing Proof General 
=======================================

With thanks to the anonymous authors of questions/answers below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Coq produces some useful output I'd like to keep a note of, how do I do that?

A. Some people cut and paste into comments in their source files.
   But you can easily make new files or temporary buffers in Emacs:

    * copy text from *response* or *goals* buffer
    * C-x b <enter new name> RET
    * Switch to correct mode: M-x coq-mode RET
    * Paste text, the highlighting/sumbols should appear correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Proof General fails to load with an error message on start-up,
    containing text like this: 
  
       Proof General was compiled for GNU Emacs 23.1 but 
       is running on Emacs 22.3: please run "make clean; make"

    What's wrong?

A. We distribute compiled .elcs for one version of Emacs, but other
    versions use different bytecode formats.  You will have to delete
    the compiled files and (optionally) recompile for your preferred
    Emacs version.  Using the Makefile:

     make clean			#   removes all .elc files.  

    and then a command like this:

     make EMACS=emacs-22.3

   (without the EMACS setting just uses 'emacs').

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I have just installed Emacs, ProofGeneral and a proof assistant.
    It works but Tokens (e.g. \<Longrightarrow>) are not being displayed 
    as symbols.

A. You need to enable Unicode Tokens by the menu item:

      Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Display -> Unicode Tokens
  
    To enable it automatically every time you use Proof General,
    use 

      Proof-General -> Quick Options -> Save Options

    after doing this.

    Note that we don't do this by default, because from the system's
    perspective it is difficult to determine if this will succeed ---
    or just produce funny characters that confuse new users even more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Q.  With Unicode symbols enabled, the symbols look a mess, e.g.
    compressed and overlap one another.

A.  Unfortunately this is a bug in the display engine inside
    certain versions of Emacs, for example the default version
    of emacs, Emacs 23.3.1 on Ubuntu 11.10, suffers from.

    The solution is to switch to another version (e.g. Emacs 23.2).

    You may be able to get better results with different fonts, even
    without upgrading Emacs.

    Proof General uses Deja Vu Sans Mono by default because
    this often works out-of-the-box.  But STIX is better if you 
    install it.  See http://www.stixfonts.org/.   On Ubuntu try:  

         sudo apt-get install fonts-stix

    To change to STIX, either

         M-x customize face RET unicode-tokens-symbol-font-face RET

    and edit to set the family name to "STIXGeneral", or edit 
    the line beginning "(defface unicode-tokens-symbol-font-face" in
    lib/unicode-tokens.el.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Help, I'm stuck!! Emacs keeps telling me "Cannot switch buffers in a
    dedicated window"  

A. This can happen if you enabled "Use Three Panes" and then change
    the panes (window) layout manually, typically by deleting another 
    window or frame so you only have a "dedicated" window on the 
    display.  Don't kill Emacs!  There are many ways of getting out,
    e.g.
    -- In single window mode, C-c C-l (proof-layout-windows) refreshes
       the display

    -- In multiple window mode, if you have accidently deleted the main
       window, get a new one with M-x new-frame RET



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I have a problem installing/using Proof General, what can I do?

A. Please check the documentation carefully, particularly the
    requirements for a full-featured and recent Emacs version, as
    mentioned in INSTALL (see "Dependency on Other Emacs Packages").  
    If you still cannot solve your problem, try to contact someone
    else who is using Proof General with a similar setup.  The
    best way to do this may be through the user mailing list for your
    proof assistant.  If you think the problem is Proof General related,
    consult the PG Wiki and Trac pages.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How can I keep the Proof General option settings across sessions?

A. For options set in the Proof General -> Options menu use the 
    "Save Options" menu item (Proof General -> Quick Options -> Save Options).

    For other options set via customize (Proof General -> Advanced -> 
    Customize), use the customize buttons, or M-x customize-save-customized.
